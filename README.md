## How to Use

1. Ensure you have compatible Python and PIP versions to setup Mediapipe.<br>
   1.1) Python version 3.8 - 3.11. You can download python 3.11.0 from official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

   1.2) PIP version: 20.3+, upgrade it if needed:
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
2. Move to the desired directory, clone repository, and install requirements.txt file:
    ```bash
    cd <repo-directory>
    ```
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/The-Mikest-Mike/Mac-Control-Gestures.git
    ```
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Install mediapipe and necessary tools:
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install mediapipe
    ```
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install  # Installs Xcode command line tools
    ```
    ```bash
    brew install gcc  # Installs GCC compiler
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
